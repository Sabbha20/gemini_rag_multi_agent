       "  'text': 'The Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe. It\\'s often divided into two main parts: Special Relativity and General Relativity.\\n\\n### 1. Special Relativity (1905)\\n\\nSpecial Relativity deals with how space and time are intertwined when things move at constant speeds, ignoring gravity for a moment. It\\'s built on two core ideas:\\n\\n*   **The laws of physics are the same for everyone moving at a constant speed.** Imagine you\\'re in a car moving smoothly; if you drop a ball, it falls the same way as if you were standing still.\\n*   **The speed of light in a vacuum is always the same for all observers**, no matter how fast they are moving or how fast the light source is moving. This is a very counter-intuitive but crucial fact.\\n\\nThese two ideas lead to some mind-bending consequences, especially at very high speeds:\\n\\n*   **Time Dilation:** Time actually slows down for objects that are moving very fast relative to you. A clock on a spaceship moving near the speed of light would tick slower than a stationary clock on Earth.\\n*   **Length Contraction:** Objects moving at high speeds appear to get shorter in the direction of their motion.\\n*   **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²):** This is perhaps the most famous equation. It states that mass (m) and energy (E) are interchangeable; a small amount of mass can be converted into a huge amount of energy (because \\'c\\', the speed of light, is a very large number, and it\\'s squared!). This is the principle behind nuclear energy.\\n\\n### 2. General Relativity (1915)\\n\\nGeneral Relativity expands on Special Relativity by including **gravity**. Einstein realized that gravity isn\\'t a force pulling objects together, but rather a result of massive objects warping the fabric of **spacetime** itself.\\n\\nImagine spacetime as a giant, flexible trampoline.\\n\\n*   If you place a small marble on it, it barely dents the surface. This is like a small planet in space.\\n*   Now, place a heavy bowling ball in the middle. It creates a deep dip. This is like a massive star or planet.\\n*   If you then roll a smaller marble nearby, it won\\'t move in a straight line; it will curve inward towards the bowling ball because of the dip in the trampoline.\\n\\nThis \"dip\" or **curvature of spacetime** caused by massive objects is what we perceive as **gravity**. Planets orbit the Sun not because the Sun is pulling them with a mysterious force, but because the Sun\\'s immense mass warps spacetime around it, and the planets simply follow the curves in that warped spacetime.\\n\\nGeneral Relativity has also predicted many phenomena that have since been observed:\\n\\n*   **Black Holes:** Regions where spacetime is so intensely curved that nothing, not even light, can escape.\\n*   **Gravitational Lensing:** Light from distant galaxies bending around massive objects (like other galaxies or galaxy clusters) on its way to Earth, creating distorted or multiple images.\\n*   **Gravitational Waves:** Ripples in spacetime created by extremely violent cosmic events, like colliding black holes, which travel outward at the speed of light. These were detected in 2015.\\n*   **GPS Systems:** The clocks on GPS satellites run slightly faster than clocks on Earth due to both Special and General Relativity effects, and these differences must be accounted for to ensure accurate positioning.\\n\\nIn simple terms, Special Relativity taught us that space and time are relative and depend on your motion, while General Relativity showed us that gravity is not a force, but a consequence of mass and energy bending the very fabric of spacetime.'}]"
